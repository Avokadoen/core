<ifreund> ikskuh: I'm not sure I'm grasping the vision of dunstblick, how do you plan to use this?
<ikskuh> aaah
<ikskuh> are you okay with spoilers for my next showtime talk? :D
<ifreund> sure :D
<ikskuh> i figured that dunstblick may be the right project for a talk
<ikskuh> i create a lot of self-made IoT devices
<ikskuh> small scale (lpc1786 or smaller) or large scale (RPI, ...)
<ikskuh> also i have a lot of services deployed on several machines
<ikskuh> my vision for dunstblick is to access all those systems with a very resource-gentle UI system
<ikskuh> web stack is too bloatet imho for that, it also requires you to write a lot of web servers and html/js frontends
<ifreund> neat, this is making a lot more sense with that use-case in mind
<ikskuh> so the idea of dunstblick is that you can easily discover applications in your local network and attach a interface to them
<ikskuh> for example: i have a rack with RGB LEDs built-in
<ikskuh> and i want to set the color/animation for those
<ikskuh> open up dunstblick, attach to "LED Control", change some colors, done
<ikskuh> same workflow for everything else
<ifreund> sounds quite handy
<ikskuh> the network-controllable power board? sure thing :D
<ikskuh> attach, flip some checkboxes, done :D
<ifreund> what all do your IoT devices do?
<ikskuh> right now, not that much :D
<ikskuh> i have these two i told you about, but i also have my stereo as IoT
<ikskuh> it's just an RPI+Amp
<ifreund> nice
<ikskuh> and i would like to control the media playing there not via SSH anymore :D
<ikskuh> another example: you could make a generic pulseaudio volume control
<ikskuh> throw that on all your machines and you can now control volume of your computer with your smartphone
<ikskuh> have a weather service sampling data from your local weather station? covered :D
