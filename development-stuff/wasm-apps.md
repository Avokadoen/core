# WebAssembly Applications

## Goals

- Run apps in a controlled environment
- Allow migration of apps from one device to another
- Platform-independent binary format (compile once, run everywhere)
- Provide the same API on all platforms and devices.
- Run on low-memory devices with only one Wasm page (64kib)
